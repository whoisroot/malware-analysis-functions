## Functions
Trying to make sense out of this chaos... 🤷

| **Function** | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `dwg_macro` 📐 | Searches for DWG files containing OLE files, tipically used for VBA macros. |
| `OLEpuke` 📦 | Recursevely search for OLE files (like Microsoft Office documents and files contained in them) and run `oleid` on them. You can use the `--short` parameter to only print the info about the files with "HIGH" or "MEDIUM" Risk. |
| `XMLpuke` 📋 | Recursively search for XML files and print them. |
| `XMLpretty` 📊 | Pretty prints the XML file(s). |
| `hashes` 🔗 | Calculates the MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes for a file. |
| `multiple_hashes2report` ⛓ | Eats filenames and spit MarkDown formated hashes for using in the Malware Analysis report. |
| `meta` 🔍 | Takes metadata for one or more files. Pretty prints file names, file types and hashes. |
| `md2html` 📝🖨 | Converts my markdown malware analysis reports into pretty HTML pages. |
| `b64` 🗞 and `b64d` 📰 | Encodes to and decodes from base64 encoding. |
| `url_encode` 📈 and `url_decode` 📉 | Encodes to and decodes from url encoded representation. |
| `noNULLstrings` 🚫 | Removes nullbytes from the file and then run `strings` on the file. Could easily be replaced by `strings -e l` to read UTF-16 strings. |
| `urlSearch` 🌐 | Regex search the file for URLs. |
| `xxdNULL` 🆓 | Searches for two sequential nullbytes in the file. |
| `ipinfo` 🌐 | Queries [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) for information on the IP address (`$1`) and filters the response JSON throght `jq`, optionaly selecting fields (`$2`). With no parameters it shows information on your public IP. The [objects](https://ipinfo.io/developers/data-types) returned depends on what add-ons you purchase for your license. |
| `myip` 🌐 | Alias to run `ipinfo` and filter the response to just return your public IP. |
| `limpa_safelinks` 🧼 | Extracts original URL from the secure redirect made by the Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing tool, _Safe Links_. |
| `get_redirects` 🔜 | Curls the given URL, follows all redirects and list them. |
| `parse_lnks` ⤴ | Extracts more useful information from the output of `lnkparse`. |
| `LNKs` 🔃 | Alias to run `parse_lnks` with all `lnk` files in the current directory. |
| `VT_query` 👾 | Queries the SHA-256 hash of the given file(s) against VirusTotal's database and returns a brief summary of the results of previous analysis. Depends on setting the `VT_API_KEY` to submit requests. |
| `VT_scan_file` 👾📄 | Alias to submit the given file to VirusTotal using @sevsec's [vt-scan](https://github.com/sevsec/vt-scan). This alias assumes you have the `vt-scan` in your path. |
| `VT_scan_url` 👾🔗 | Alias to submit the given URL to VirusTotal using @sevsec's [vt-scan](https://github.com/sevsec/vt-scan). This alias assumes you have the `vt-scan` in your path. |
| `VT_scan_domain` 👾📝 | Alias to submit the given domain to VirusTotal using @sevsec's [vt-scan](https://github.com/sevsec/vt-scan). This alias assumes you have the `vt-scan` in your path. |
| `VT_scan_ip` 👾#️⃣ | Alias to submit the given ip to VirusTotal using @sevsec's [vt-scan](https://github.com/sevsec/vt-scan). This alias assumes you have the `vt-scan` in your path. |
| `VT_wait_analysis` ⏳👾 | Receives the base64 identifier from the `VT_scan_*` functions, then queries the API every 30 seconds to see if the job is still in the queue and displays the results when completed. |

## Variables
You can change them in the script or re-export them after importing the functions in your `.bashrc`, whatever you prefer.

| **Variable** | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `color` 🎨 | A string with [ANSI SGR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI\_escape_code#SGR\_(Select\_Graphic\_Rendition)\_parameters) separated by semicolons. By default it's `1;4;36`, making the text bold, underlined and cyan. I totally understand if you find this uggly, but I like the contrast on the terminal |
| `XMLLINT_INDENT` 📏 | By default a string with 4 spaces, but maybe you want tabs, 2 spaces, I don't know. |
| `CSS_file` 💁‍♀️ | A file containing all the CSS style rules you want to include in the the rendered HTML generated from the markdown by the `md2html` function. |
| `IPINFO_AUTH` 🔑 | Your ipinfo.io API key. This should be set in your `.bashrc` to, first and foremost, avoid the annoying `"readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"` message on the response JSON when you don't authenticate. Also, with the API key you get more information on your queries according to the add-ons you pay for. You can get a free API key with 50k queries/month by just [registering](https://ipinfo.io/signup). |
| `DEBUG` 🐛 | By default an undefined variable, but if set some functions echo debug information to `stderror`. I like to set it to 1 when in use, but anything not-null goes, really. |
| `VT_API_KEY` 🔑 | VirusTotal API key used to query their database for information on suspicious files. You can obtain your key by [registering](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us) and, after loging in, [retrieving you key](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey). The free API key lets you do 500 lookups per day, if you need more you can subscribe to the [premium services](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/services-overview) for more queries and other, much more useful, features. This should be set in your `.bashrc`. |

## Dependencies

First of all, why do you want emoji?!☢?!⚠?!❓⁉‼❕❗❔

Before you insist in this mad act, make shure your terminal support emoji. I like to use [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), but you do you boo 🙃.

To use this in its full potential, you need to install `coreutils` (for `base64` and hashsum functions), `file`, `python3`, `lolcat` (because colors make it pretty), `pandoc` (render Markdown to HTML), `jq` (parse and pretty-print JSON),`libxml2-utils` (we use `xmllint` to pretty-print XML), `cURL` and the python packages `lnkparse`, `oletools` and `urllib`.

Also, most of the VirusTotal interfacing functions depend on @sevsec's [vt-scan](https://github.com/sevsec/vt-scan) tool.

Optionally, I also recommend installing [bashacks](https://github.com/merces/bashacks), which contains various nice functions and is a much more mature project.

**apt** (Debian/Ubuntu/Kali/Mint):
> ```bash
> sudo apt install coreutils file python{3,-pip} lolcat pandoc jq libxml2-utils curl
> pip install urllib lnkparse oletools
> wget -O $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevsec/vt-scan/master/vt-scan.sh
> chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan
> ```

**dnf** (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS):
> ```bash
> sudo dnf install coreutils file python3{,-pip} lolcat pandoc jq libxml2-utils curl
> pip install urllib lnkparse oletools
> chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan
> wget -O $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevsec/vt-scan/master/vt-scan.sh
> ```

**pacman** (I use Arch, BTW):
> ```bash
> pacman -Sy coreutils file python{,-pip} lolcat pandoc jq libxml2-utils curl
> pip install urllib lnkparse oletools
> chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan
> wget -O $HOME/.local/bin/vt-scan https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevsec/vt-scan/master/vt-scan.sh
> ```
